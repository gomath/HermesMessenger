/**
 * LOGIN VIEW VISUAL TESTING
 * The login view creates the window for user’s to enter credentials
 * to log on onto the chat server. The constructor is easily verified
 * to be correct because the components are correctly displayed in the
 * window and displayed correctly. This includes the title text, the
 * text fields to enter IP address, port number, username, and color.
 * The only user action in this view is to enter information and submit.
 * Entering valid information will correctly login the user (previously
 * verified by printing the messages passed between server and client),
 * and call to UserGUI that opens the conversation view is successful.
 * If any of the credentials is incorrect, a dialog pop up appears
 * explaining the error and returns the user to the login screen to try again.
