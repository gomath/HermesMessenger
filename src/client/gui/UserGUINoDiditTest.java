 * UserGUI is in charge of opening and closing the appropriate windows.
 * This was visually tested by running the client. This opens the login
 * window. Entering credentials to log in will close the login view and
 * open the conversation view. Hitting the logout button in the conversation
 * view will close the conversation view and open the login view. These transitions
 * all worked properly.
