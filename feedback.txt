Feedback
--------

Snapshot diagram and protocol:
You guys had a solid plan and diagram, though you could have maybe
had a little more discussion of possible alternatives.

System design and testing:
Fantastic job on both. Your milestone 2 was very solid and your
testing strategy and implementation were both great.

Code:
Your code was generally quite readable, but your organization was a
little bit off. In particular, having all of the user information
stored in the client made it a little bit hard to follow the server
code. Other than that, great job.

Nice job on the colors! I particularly liked how the tab changed
color.
